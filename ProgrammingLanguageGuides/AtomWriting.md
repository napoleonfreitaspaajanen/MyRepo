# Packages and atom settings

- The command palette can be opened by CTRL+SHIFT+P (called CP from now on)
- pdf-view allows to see pdfs inside platformio
- Settings > Editor set tabtype to soft and two spaces.
- Packages > autocomplete plus > autocomplete only on tab (otherwise also completes on enter)
- To see invisibles, press window: toggle invisibles in CP
- Markdown document outline package is helpful to nagivate quickly. Needs a vertical split though

# Pandoc
To use Pandoc to convert to pdf, you need the package platformio-ide-terminal.
This allows to use the terminal inside of Atom. Once installed, it can be called with the command Ctrl-\`.  

Note you need to install latex separately and add it to your path.

These are the commands for using pandoc. Call the commands in the terminal.

**pandoc markdownfilename.md -s -o view.pdf**  
Creates a pdf called view.pdf from the file markdownfilename.md.  
Option -s for standalone and option -o for output.  
Add --toc for table of contents


# Markdown

**Beginning a document**

Between triple lines (---) write the title and author, as follows:  
\-\-\-  
title: Something  
author: myself  
\-\-\-  

**Lists**

Do two enters and - (slash). Looks like this:

- First
- Second

To indent the lists, use a tab:

- First
  - Second

**Small but useful**

To do a single linebreak, use two spaces and enter. To change paragraph, use two enters. A single enter doesn't do anything.

To write taken characters, use the escape character backslash \\.  
Known taken characters are:  
\-\-\-  
\`

# Using Git  
First install Git. It is required to work properly.  
On Git bash, write the following commands for set up:  
git config --global user.name "Napoleon Freitas Paajanen"  
git config --global user.email "napoleonfreitaspaajanen@gmail.com"  
currently using the following sites:  

Basics of git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository

Possibly in the future use "git-control" package for easier use.

**Initialize git**

This can be done inside Atom.

- File > Open Folder > "find the folder you want to control"
- Press the arrow on the right side of editor (not visible until you put your mouse over there) of Atom to open the git panel
- Press Create Repository > init

**Pushing an existing repository to github**

- First initialize git on the folder (separate instruction)
- Then commit some initial files (separate instruction)
- Next start a new repo in github with the same name as the folder in your computer, but don't initialize with a README (don't click on that option)
- Launch git bash on the target folder in your computer and do
  - git remote add origin "name of github url"
  - git push -u origin master
  - You might need to put some passwords or something at this stage

**Clone a repository**

- Go to github and get the "clone url"
- Open git bash and write git clone "clone url"

**Staging, adding, committing and others.**

This can all be done internally in Atom so one does not need to know commands. However, if one wants to use the git bash, one can use:
- Stage all: git add .
- Need to add more when I feel like it. For now, use Atom.

# Latex
In order to use Latex commands, use double dollars \$\$. E.g.,  
$$ y \in R(A) $$

**Adding a package**  
In the header, set the following:  
header-includes: |  
\\usepackage{amsthm}

# Coding

```python
Code block
if mood == 'happy':
  print('hello')
```
